# BallotOnline Azure PoC

Welcome to the `azure_ballotonline_cicd` repository! This project is a capstone demonstration of implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using Azure services.

BallotOnline is a fictional company created for the purpose of this proof of concept. The goal of this project is to showcase the integration and deployment of both Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) on Azure.

Within this repository, you'll find:
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts to provision Azure resources.
- Source code for the web application.
- Configuration files and scripts for the CI/CD pipeline.
- Documentation to guide you through the setup and deployment process.

This project highlights best practices for deploying and managing cloud resources in a modern DevOps environment, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of Azure's capabilities in supporting robust CI/CD workflows.
